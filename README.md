# dokku-scripts

Scripts to help with UCSB ECI's installation of Dokku

The files `dokku-functions.sh` and `dokku-functions-m23` contain bash functions that
can be imported into the other scripts to perform various operations.

* `dokku-function.sh` contains functions that should be generic enough to
  work across multiple instances of courses using dokku.

* `dokku-functions-m23.sh` contains functions that are
  specfic to the M23 instances of CMPSC156.
